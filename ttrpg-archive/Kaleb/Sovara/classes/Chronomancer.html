                <h3>Time Step</h3>
                <p>
                    At first level, you gain the ability to teleport anywhere you could reach with a Move action as a bonus action. You cannot use this feature two turns in a row.
                </p>
                <h3>Archetype</h3>
                <p>
                    At second level, you choose an archetype. This gives you bonuses at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 13th, and 18th level. Archetypes are listed below.
                </p>
                <h3>Undo</h3>
                <p>
                    At 3rd level, when you fail an attack roll or ability check, you can take back the action, bonus action, or reaction used to make the roll. If you do, you cannot make that same action that turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum one) per short rest.
                </p>
                <h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
                <p>
                    When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
                </p>
                <h3>Extra Attack</h3>
                <p>
                    At 5th level, you may make two weapon attacks when you use the Attack action. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 15th level in this class.
                </p>
                <h3>Recall</h3>
                <p>
                    At 7th level, the first time you hit with a ranged attack (either magical or nonmagical) each turn, you may call the projectile back to you. Make another ranged attack roll against the target with advantage. If the projectile is physical, the weapon or ammunition returns to a readied state, and can be fired or thrown again on your next attack.
                </p>
                <h3>Fast Forward</h3>
                <p>
                    Beginning at 9th level, travel times are halved for you and a number of other creatures traveling with you equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum one).
                </p>
                <h3>Reverse Wounds</h3>
                <p>
                    At 11th level, you gain a pool of hit points equal to ten times your Charisma modifier (minimum one). When you lose hit points you can use your reaction to use a number of hit points from this pool to heal yourself. You cannot restore more hit points than you lost when you took the damage that triggered this reaction.
                </p>
                <h3>Improved Time Step</h3>
                <p>
                    Beginning at 14th level, you can use Time Step each turn. In addition, when you use Time Step, you can bring one creature within five feet with you. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Charisma save against 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency modifier. On a successful save, they are not teleported, and are immune to this effect for the next ten minutes.
                </p>
                <h3>Reconstitute</h3>
                <p>
                    At 17th level, you gain the ability to rejuvenate and repair organic materials and simple inorganic structures. You learn the Mending cantrip, and can use it to repair breaks or tears up to 10 feet in any dimension.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You also gain the ability to restore bodies to a state where they can be revived. This can reform a body that has been destroyed (i.e. via Disintegrate), or to allow a body that has been dead for over 200 years to be revived. This can only be done once per long rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, you gain the ability to remove a level of exhaustion from a willing creature within five feet as a bonus action. You may do this a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum one) per long rest.
                </p>
                <h3>Master of Time</h3>
                <p>
                    At 20th level, you gain a second action each round. You may use this action at whichever point in the initiative you choose, but you may not interrupt another action, bonus action, or reaction with it.
                </p>

                <h3 class="spell-feature">Spellcasting</h3>
                <h4>Cantrips</h4>
                <p>
                    You learn two cantrips of your choice from the sorceror spell list. You learn an additional sorceror cantrip at 10th level.
                </p>
                <h4>Spell Slots</h4>
                <p>
                    From 2nd level onward, you gain spell slots as shown in the Anomaly Master Spellcasting Table.
                </p>
                <h4>Spells Known</h4>
                <p>
                    You know two 1st level sorceror spells of your choice. You learn additional spells (also from the sorceror spell list) as you level up, as shown in the Anomaly Master Spellcasting Table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever you gain a level in this class you may replace one of your known spells with another spell from the sorceror spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
                </p>
                <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
                <p>
                    Your spellcasting ability is Charisma. Your spell save DC is the same as your chronomancer ability save DC. Your spellcasting modifier is your Charisma modifier + your proficiency modifier.
                </p>
                <h3>Spatial Distortion</h3>
                <p>
                    Beginning at 6th level, whenever you cast a spell, you may either shift 10' in any direction, gain a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on your next saving throw against magic or psionics, or, if the spell was of first level or higher, gain temporary hit points equal to the spell's level times your Charisma modifier until the end of your next turn.
                </p>
                <h3>Stasis</h3>
                <p>
                    At 10th level, you gain the ability to place objects and creatures within 15' of you in stasis as an action. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Charisma save to resist this effect. Affected creatures are incapable of taking any actions and are unaware of any changes in their surroundings, but they cannot be damaged, affected by conditions, or interacted with in any way. Any effects on a creature with a set duration (including permanent and semipermanent) resume affecting the target once this effect ends, but any effects that can be dismissed by other creatures cease affecting the target.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Affected objects that aren't being worn, wielded, or carried cannot be moved, used, or damaged. Affected objects that are being worn, wielded, or carried cannot be damaged and lose all magical properties for the duration of the effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can keep objects and creatures in stasis for a number of turns equal to your Charisma modifier per long rest. You may only have one creature or object in stasis at a time. A creature or object comes out of stasis at the same point in initiative that it entered stasis unless you choose to extend this ability. Extending this ability requires you to maintain concentration, and if you lose concentration, then the effect ends at the point in initiative that it would normally end.
                </p>
                <h3>Paradoxical Mind</h3>
                <p>
                    At 13th level you gain resistance to Psychic damage, advantage on saving throws against spells and psionics, and proficiency in Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws.
                </p>
                <h3>Arcane Singularity</h3>
                <p>
                    At 18th level, you gain the ability to cast Reverse Gravity once per long rest without expending a spell slot. When you cast Reverse Gravity, rather than a cylinder, it affects a 50' radius sphere. Creatures that fail their Dexterity saves are pulled into the singularity in the center of the area. If a creature starts its turn in the singularity, it takes 5d6 + 20 Force damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature dies instantly, as per the Disintegrate spell, as the creature's body has been crushed, converted into mana, and dumped into the Astral Sea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All spells cast from within the singularity have a 95% chance to fail, and any spells cast from within the singularity's area of effect have a 25% chance to fail. Ranged attacks that pass through the area automatically miss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beginning at 19th level, you may expend your 4th level spell slot to cast Reverse Gravity an additional time.
                </p>
                <h3 class="archetype-name">Clockwork Sentinel</h3>
                <h3>Foresight</h3>
                <p>
                    When you choose this archetype at second level, you gain the ability to add your Charisma modifier to your Armor Class and Dexterity saving throws.
                </p>
                <h3>Unnatural Steed</h3>
                <p>
                    Beginning at 6th level, whenever you roll initiative you gain the effects of the Haste spell. You must maintain concentration on this effect as if it were a spell.
                </p>
                <h3>Unrelenting</h3>
                <p>
                    Starting at 10th level, you can no longer be affected by the Slow spell. In addition, you do not lose your action or movement the turn after Haste wears off.
                </p>
                <h3>Postponed Shutdown</h3>
                <p>
                    Starting at 13th level, when you begin a turn with zero hit points, you may take your turn as if you had 1 hit point. In addition, when you use this feature, you do not fail death saves when hit until the start of your next turn, though you may still be killed outright. You automatically fail a death save at the end of each turn you use this feature.
                </p>
                <h3>Supreme Speed</h3>
                <p>
                    Beginning at 18th level, while under the effects of the Haste spell, you also gain an extra bonus action.
                </p>
                <h3 class="archetype-name">Psionic Conduit</h3>
                <h3>Altered State</h3>
                <p>
                    At 2nd level, your unmasked power becomes a beacon in space and time, and something from somewhere else finds you. You lose the construct tag. In its place you gain either the celestial, fiend, fey, or aberration tag. You gain benefits based on your choice as you gain levels in this subclass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You also gain three minor psionic talents and a d6 psionic die. As you gain levels in this or other psionic classes or subclasses, you gain psionic talents, traits, and die increases as shown on the <a href="ttrpg-archive/Kaleb/more/psionics.html">Psionic Class Progression</a> table.
                </p>
                <h3>Planar Knowledge</h3>
                <p>
                    At 2nd level, the entity sometimes decides to share its knowledge with you. You gain proficiency and expertise in one skill, depending on your new creature type.
                    <ul>
                    <li>Celestial: Religion</li>
                    <li>Fiend: Insight</li>
                    <li>Fey: Nature</li>
                    <li>Aberration: History</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Planar Enhancement</h3>
                <p>
                    At 6th level, the entity that connected itself to you grants you a physical bonus. In addition, any chronomancer class features that use your Charisma score or modifier can instead use your Intelligence.
                    <ul>
                    <li>Celestial: You gain resistance to Radiant damage and whenever you gain hit points or temporary hit points, you can add your Intelligence or Charisma modifier to the number gained.</li>
                    <li>Fiend: You cannot be compelled to tell the truth by any spells or magical effects of 11th level or below. You can also add Necrotic or Fire damage equal to your Intelligence or Charisma modifier to any attack roll you make.</li>
                    <li>Fey: You can counter charm, enthrall, fear, and horror effects. (If you succeed on a saving throw against one of those effects, or if you are immune to said effect, you can force the creature that attempted to inflict that effect upon you to make a save against its own effect.) You also have advantage on saving throws against all of those effects.</li>
                    <li>Aberration: You gain immunity to Psychic damage, and 5' of true sight, plus an additional 5' times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Planar Form</h3>
                <p>
                    At 10th level, your appearance begins changing dramatically, and your new form makes you more similar to your subspace contact.
                    <ul>
                    <li>Celestial: Any damage to your plating slowly mends itself, leaving no hint of the prior damage. You become immune to exhaustion and Radiant damage, and gain the ability to enter an hour-long healing trance that functions as a long rest. In addition, your plating becomes either divine voidsteel, celestial marble, or Yggdrasil's bark, removing any damage vulnerabilities or stealth penalties you may have had, and granting you immunity to any effects that would disable any of your senses.</li>
                    <li>Fiend: Your plating bends and twists into a dark form, taking upon itself characteristics of the craftsmanship of the Dark Legions of Styx. Whenever you deal Necrotic damage, you heal for the same amount, and whenever you deal Fire damage, it ignores resistance. In addition, your plating becomes either Stygian iron, blackstone, or a mass of rotvines. Stygian iron grants you resistance to damage taken from spells and magic effects. Blackstone grants you immunity to nonmagical Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. Finally, rotvine allows you to release a potent Stygian poison gas, inflicting the Poisoned condition on all living non-fiend creatures within 15' of you for 2d4 rounds. This poison can only be cured via divine magic.</li>
                    <li>
                        Fey: You become much lighter on your feet, gaining advantage on all athletics checks if you're stone-plated, acrobatics if metal-plated, or stealth if wood-plated. In addition, one type of fey plant begins growing on you, giving you one of the effects listed below. The plant is very hardy, and survives as long as you do. Other fey plants may be allowed by your DM.
                        <ul>
                        <li>Grasping Vine: You have advantage on checks made to grapple. A creature that hits you with a melee weapon attack must make a DC 15 Strength save or lose its next attack as part of the same Attack action, if it has any.</li>
                        <li>Spirit Moss: You have resistance to Force damage. Additionally you gain the ability to move through any barriers that don't extend into the ethereal plane when you use Time Step a number of times equal to your Charisma or Intelligence modifier per long rest.</li>
                        <li>Spitter Vine: Once per round, you can shoot an acidic bolt at one creature within 30' as an unarmed ranged attack roll modified by your Intelligence or Charisma. The bolt deals 2d4 Acid damage on a hit, and the target becomes vulnerable to Acid damage for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence or Charisma modifier if it wasn't already resistant or immune to it.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Aberration: Your plating takes on an unrecognizable or alien appearance. You gain a flying speed equal to 5' plus an additional 5' times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0). You can also become incorporeal for a round a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier per long rest.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Psionic Relay</h3>
                <p>
                    Beginning at 13th level, you can communicate over vast distances using only your mind. You gain the ability to use the Sending spell at will, although it is psionic, rather than magic, and the target must either be psionic, or have telepathy to respond.

                    At 18th level, you gain the ability to psionically Planeshift once per short rest. You cannot use major psionic talents for 1 hour after doing so. While on a plane associated with your creature tag, your psionic talents are twice as effective and their recharge value is halved. Additionally, you cannot be forcibly moved by magic or psionic means. Finally, you gain an additional talent based on your creature tag.
